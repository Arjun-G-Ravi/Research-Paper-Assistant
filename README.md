# Research-Paper-Assistant
An assistant who reads research paper and summarises it for us. Tried to implement it locally using llama2.**But probably cannot be done in any other model than GPT4 due to context window size difference.**

# How to use it
Input an arxiv link. The paper will automatically be downloaded in **paper_downloads** folder. The ai will read the paper and will explain it in a simple template.
## Incomplete right now :(

# Future plans

 - Implement GPT 4 using API
 - Take input as pdf also, along with arxiv link
 - Make a custom pdf to txt converter. All current one sucks.
 - A UI for users not familiar with the interface
